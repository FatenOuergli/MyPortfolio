This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, designed to present who I am as an engineer and showcase the projects I have worked on across software development, artificial intelligence, and emerging technologies. 


It highlights my technical skills, academic journey, and hands-on experience through real projects, experiments, and continuous learning. 


The website is regularly updated as I grow, explore new tools, and build solutions with real-world impact. 


Feel free to explore the projects, review the code, and follow my progress.
